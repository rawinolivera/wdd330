        <h2>Javascript Novide to Ninja - Chapter 09: The Window Object</h2>
        <p><span style="color: #fff;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #000;">The Window Object</span></p>
        <p>The Browser Object Model (BOM) is a collection of properties and methods that contain information about the
            browser and computer screen. It can also be used for the rather dubious practice of creating pop-up windows,
            if you’re into annoying your users. <br>Properties and methods are made available throught the window
            object. The BOM only make sense in a browser invironment.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">Going Global --></span> Global Variables
            are created without using the const, let or var keywords. Global variables
            can be accessed in all parts of the program. They are actual properties of a global object.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">Dialogs:</span> three functions that
            produced dialogs in the brosers -> alert(), confirm() and prompt(). <br>
            window.alert() method will paused the execution of the program and display a message in a dialog box.
            <br>window.confirm()will stop the execution of the program and display a confirmation dialog that shows the
            message provided as an argument, and giving the options OK or Cancel. It returns the boolean values of true
            if the user clicks OK, and false if the user clicks Cancel. <br>window.prompt() method will stop the
            execution of the program. It displays a dialog that shows a message provided as an argument, as well as an
            input field taht allows the user to enter text. This text is then returned as a string when the user clicks
            OK. If the user clicks Cancel, null is returned.
        </p>
        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">Browser Information --></span> has a
            navigator property that returns a reference to the Navigator object. The
            Navigator object contains information about the browser being used. Its userAgent property will return
            information about the browser and operating system being used. <br>Don’t rely on this information though, as
            it can be modified by a user to masquerade as a different browser. It can also be difficult to make any
            sense of the string returned, because all browsers pretend to be others to some degree.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">Location --></span> The window.location
            property is an object that contains information about the URL of the current
            page. It contains a number of properties that provide information about different fragments of the URL.
            <br>window.location.href -> returns the full URL as a string. This property is a read/write property, which
            means it can also be changed by assignment. If this is done, the page will be reloaded using the new
            property.<br> -> window.location.protocol returns a string describing the protocol used (such as http,
            https, pop2, ftp etc.). Note that there is a colon (:) at the end. <br>-> window.location.host returns a
            string describing the domain of the current URL and the port number (this is often omitted if the default
            port 80 is used). <br>-> window.location.hostname returns a string describing the domain of the current URL
            <br>-> window.location.port returns a string describing the port number, although it will return an empty
            string if the port is not explicitly stated in the URL. <br>-> window.location.pathname returns a string of
            the path that follows the domain. <br>->window.location.search returns a string that starts with a “?”
            followed by the query string parameters. It returns an empty string if there are no query string parameters.
            <br>-> window.location.hash returns a string that starts with a “#” followed by the fragment identifier. It
            returns an empty string if there is no fragment identifier. <br>-> window.location.origin returns a string
            that shows the protocol and domain where the current page originated from. This property is read-only, so
            cannot be changed. <br>The window.location object also has the following methods: reload(), assign(),
            replace() and toString().
        </p>
        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">The Browser History --></span> The
            window.history property can be used to access information about any previously
            visited pages in the current browser session. Avoid confusing this with the new HTML5 History API. <br> The
            window.history.length property shows how many pages have been visited before arriving at the current page.
            <br> The window.history.go() method can be used to go to a specific page, where 0 is the current page.
            <br>There are also the window.history.forward() and window.history.back() methods that can be used to
            navigate forwards and backwards by one page respectively, just like using the browser’s forward and back
            buttons.
        </p>
        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">Controlling Windows --></span> A new
            window can be opened using the window.open() method. This takes the URL of the
            page to be opened as its first parameter, the window title as its second parameter, and a list of attributes
            as the third parameter. This can also be assigned to a variable, so the window can then be referenced later
            in the code. </p>
        <div style="text-align:center;"> <img src="../images/window-open.JPG" alt="window.open code"> </div>
        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;"></span>The close() method can be used to
            close a window, assuming you have a reference to it: popup.close(); <br>It
            is also
            possible to move a window using the window.moveTo() method and resize a window using the window.resizeTo()
            method.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">Screen Information --></span> The
            window.screen object contains information about the screen the browser is
            displayed on. You can find out the height and width of the screen in pixels using the height and width
            properties respectively. The availHeight and availWidth can be used to find the height and width of the
            screen, excluding any operating system menus. <br>The colorDepth property can be used to find the color bit
            depth of the user’s monitor, although there are few use cases for doing this other than collecting user
            statistics.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">The Document Object --></span> Each
            window object contains a document object. This object has properties and methods
            that deal with the page that has been loaded into the window. <br>The write() method simply writes a string
            of text to the page: <br>->document.write('Hello, world!'); <br>It is possible to include HTML in the string
            and this will become part of the DOM tree. The document.write() method can also be used within a document
            inside 'script' tags to inject a string into the markup. This will not overwrite the rest of the HTML on the
            page.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">Cookies --></span> are small files that
            are saved locally on a user's computer invented by Netscape as a way of
            getting round HTTP being a stateless protocol. Cookies can be used for personalizing a user’s browsing
            experience, storing user preferences, keeping track of user choices (such as a shopping cart),
            authentication and tracking users. Cookies are still useful for retaining state information (such as if a
            user is logged in) because they’re passed between the client and server on every HTTP request. Cookies take
            the form of a text file that contain a list of name/value
            pairs separated by semicolons. <br>document.coockie -> Creating cookies -> Changing Coockies Values ->
            Reading Cookies.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">Timing Functions --></span> The window
            object provides some useful methods for scheduling the execution of a
            function, and for repeatedly executing functions at regular intervals. <br>-> window.setTimeout() method
            accepts a callback to a function as its first parameter and a number of milliseconds as its second
            parameter. <br>->window.setInterval() method works in a similar way to window.setTimeout(), except that it
            will repeatedly invoke the callback function after every given number of milliseconds.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">Animation --></span> The setTimeOut()
            and setInterval() methods can be used to animate elements on a web page.</p>
        <h2>The Content Template element -- from https://developer.mozilla.org/</h2>
        <p>The template tag HTML element is a mechanism for holding HTML that is not to be rendered immediately when a
                page is loaded but may be instantiated subsequently during runtime using JavaScript.</p>
