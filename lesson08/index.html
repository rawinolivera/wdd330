        <h2> JavaScript: Novice to Ninja - Chapter 14 HTML5 APIs</h2>
        <p>HTML5 was for HTML what ES6 was for JavaScript – it added a large number of new features to the
            specification. It also went beyond the actual markup language and brought together a number of related
            technologies such as CSS and JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">HTML5</span>
        </p>
        <p>The HTML5 specification is separated into modules that allow different features to be developed at different
            paces then implemented without having to wait for other features to be completed.</p>

        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">The data- Attribute</span></p>
        <p>The data- attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page using custom attributes that are ignored by the
            browser. They’re also private to a page, so are not intended to be used by an external service – their sole
            purpose is to be used by a JavaScript program. <br>The names of these attributes can be decided by the
            developer, but they must use the following format:</p>
        <p>
            <span style="color: #fff;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #000;">Start with data-.</span><br>
            <span style="color: #fff;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #000;">Contain only lowercase letters, numbers,
                hyphens,
                dots, colons or underscores.</span><br>
            <span style="color: #fff;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #000;">Include an optional string value.</span><br>
        </p>
        <p>Each element has a dataset property that can be used to access any data- attributes it contains. <br>Data
            attributes provide a convenient way of adding data directly into the HTML markup, enabling a richer user
            experience.</p>

        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">HTML5 APIs</span>
        </p>
        <p>The HTML5 specification contains a number of APIs that help to gain access to hardware, such as cameras,
            batteries, geolocation, and the graphics card. Hardware evolves quickly, and APIs are frequently introduced
            to give developers access, and control new features that appear in the latest devices.</p>


        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">HTML5 Web Storage --></span> The Web
            Storage API provides a key-value store on the client’s computer that is similar to using cookies but has
            fewer restrictions, more storage capacity, and is generally easier to use.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Web Storage API has some crucial differences with cookies:
        <ul>
            <li>Information stored is not shared with the server on every request.</li>
            <li>Information is available in multiple windows of the browser (but only if the domain is the same).</li>
            <li>Storage capacity limit is much larger than the 4KB limit for cookies ( There is no actual limit in the
                specification, but most browsers have a limit set at 5GB per domain.).</li>
            <li>Any data stored does not automatically expire as it does with cookies. This potentially makes cookies a
                better choice for something like showing a popup once a day.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>Every time a value is saved to local storage, a storage event is fired. Note that this event is only fired on
            any other windows or tabs from the same domain, and only if the value of the item being saved changes. <br>
        </p>

        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">Geolocation --></span> The Geolocation
            API is used to obtain the geographical position of the device. This means it can be used to find the user’s
            exact location, then link to nearby places or measure the speed at which the user is moving. This
            information can then be used to filter data based on the user's location or speed and direction of travel.
        </p>

        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">Web Workers --></span> Web workers allow
            processes to be run in the background, adding support for concurrency in JavaScript. The idea is that any
            processes that could take a long time are carried out in the background, so a website will continue to
            function without fear of the dreaded 'script has become unresponsive' message that occurs when a script runs
            for too long. <br> Web workers use the concept of messages to communicate back and forth between the main
            script and worker script. The postMessage() method can be used to send a message and start the worker
            working. The argument to this method can send any data to the web worker. To post a message to the worker.
        </p>

        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">Service Workers --></span> The Service
            Worker API allows a worker script to run in the background with the added benefit of being able to intercept
            network requests. This allows you to take alternative action if the network is offline, and effectively
            create app-like offline experiences. Service workers also allow access to push notifications and background
            syncing. Service workers require a secure network to run on HTTPS to avoid any malicious code hijacking
            network requests.
        </p>

        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">Websockets --></span> The main form of
            communication on the web has always been the HTTP protocol. This uses a system of request and response to
            send data back and forth. <br>Websocket is a new protocol that allows two-way communication with a server –
            also known as push messaging. This means that a connection is kept open and responses are ‘pushed’ to the
            client as soon as they are received.
        </p>

        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">Notifications --></span> The
            Notification API allows you to show messages using the system's notifications. This is usually a popup in
            the corner of the screen, but it changes depending on the operating system. An advantage of using the system
            notification is that they will still be displayed even if the web page that calls them isn't the current
            tab. <br> Depending on your browser and operating system, some notifications close automatically after a
            short period of time, and some will stay on the screen until the user clicks on them. You can close the
            notification programmatically using the close() method.
        </p>

        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">Multimedia --></span> HTML5 introduced
            the < audio> and < video> tags used to insert audio and video clips into a web page. It also introduced a
                    Media API for controlling the playback of the clips using JavaScript. <br>An audio clip can be
                    inserted into a page with the < audio> tag, using the src attribute to point to the audio file.
                        <br>A
                        video clip can be inserted with the < video> tag, using the src attribute to point to the movie
                            file. <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Audio and video clips also have a number of events that will fire when they occur, including:
        <ul>
            <li>The play event, which fires when the clip starts and when it resumes after a pause.</li>
            <li>The pause event, which fires when the clip is paused.</li>
            <li>The volumechange event, which fires when the volume is changed.</li>
            <li>The loadedmetadata event, which we saw in the note above, and which fires when all the video's metadata
                has loaded.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            The audio and video elements bring native support for multimedia into the browser, and the API gives
            developers full control of the playback of audio tracks and video clips.
        </p>

        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">Drawing with Canvas</span>
        </p>
        <p>The canvas element was introduced to allow graphics to be drawn onto a web page in real time using
            JavaScript. A canvas element is a rectangular element on the web page. It has a coordinate system that
            starts at (0,0) in the top-left corner.
        </p>

        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">Shims and Polyfills</span>
        </p>
        <p>Libraries of code that allow you to use the APIs as usual. They then fill in the necessary code that's
            not provided natively by the user’s browser. <br> The terms shim and polyfill are often used
            interchangeably. The main difference between them is that a shim is a piece of code that adds some missing
            functionality to a browser, although the implementation method may differ slightly from the standard API. A
            polyfill is a shim that achieves the same functionality, while also using the API commands that would be
            used if the feature was supported natively.
