        <h1>Notes - Reading Lesson 01</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>For this lesson 01, the reading session included Working with groups, Managing the moderm Frontend Workflow
            and I also took the sitepoint course about Git. 
            I have to say that this was the first time I studied the command for git and definitely I enjoied it too much...</p>
        <p>This Git course included lots of commands and also theory, but what I loved the most was discover how this
            git tech helps teams to work together... the version control is amazing, while I was watching at the
            differente examples in the course I imagined how will be to work in a branch knowing that a the end of the
            day my code will be consider and merged to other member's team code so we get a better product, that really
            blew my mind up.</p>
        <p>I'm still kind of confused about the stages on git, that take me to a question... <br> after the "git -a"
            command, the terminal shows a list of the created branches, the master and also shows in red color the
            remote branches... I think those in red are the ones that represent the stages, but then we have to delete
            them... that caused me a little confusion! <br> so, What's the purpose of that?</p>
