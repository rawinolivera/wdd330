        <h2>Get Started with JSON Web Tokens</h2>
        <p>JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for
            securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and
            trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with HMAC algorithm) or a
            public/private key pair using RSA.
        </p>
        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">JSON WEB TOKEN STRUCTURE</span>
        </p>
        <p>JWTs consist of three parts separated by dots (.), which are: <br> <br>

            <span style="color: #fff;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #000;">Header:</span> typically consists of two
            parts: the type of the token, which is JWT, and the hashing algorithm such
            as HMAC SHA256 or RSA. <br>
            <span style="color: #fff;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #000;">Payload:</span> contains the claims. Claims
            are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional
            metadata. There are three types of claims: reserved, public, and private claims. <br>
            <span style="color: #fff;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #000;">Signature:</span> To create the signature
            part you have to take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret,
            the algorithm specified in the header, and sign that. <br>
            Therefore, a JWT typically looks like the following. <br> <br>

            xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz <br> <br>
        </p>

        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">Call and Apply Methods --></span> In
            authentication, when the user successfully logs in using their credentials, a JSON Web Token will be
            returned. Since tokens are credentials, great care must be taken to prevent security issues. In general, you
            should not keep tokens longer than required. <br>

            You also should not store sensitive session data in browser storage due to lack of security. <br>

            Whenever the user wants to access a protected route, it should send the JWT, typically in the Authorization
            header using the Bearer schema. Therefore the content of the header should look like the following.

        <p>Benefits of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) comparing it to Simple Web Tokens (SWT) and Security
            Assertion Markup Language Tokens (SAML).

            As JSON is less verbose than XML, when it is encoded its size is also smaller; making JWT more compact than
            SAML. This makes JWT a good choice to be passed in HTML and HTTP environments. <br>

            Security-wise, SWT can only be symmetric signed by a shared secret using the HMAC algorithm. While JWT and
            SAML tokens can also use a public/private key pair in the form of a X.509 certificate to sign them. However,
            signing XML with XML Digital Signature without introducing obscure security holes is very difficult compared
            to the simplicity of signing JSON. <br>

            JSON parsers are common in most programming languages, because they map directly to objects, conversely XML
            doesnâ€™t have a natural document-to-object mapping. This makes it easier to work with JWT than SAML
            assertions.

            Regarding usage, JWT is used at an Internet scale. This highlights the ease of client side processing of
            JWTs on multiple platforms, especially, mobile.

        <p>After hearing his talk, I feel kind of confuse... A truly developer knows how to get the best when avoid
            using all of recent tools which facilitate the job. <br> One of his phrases: we use other people code to
            create ours... <br>He ends saying this is your work to build... made me think that I have to challeng myself
            and move forward because there's a lot to do!!</p>
