        <h2>Javascript Novide to Ninja - Chapter 10: Testing and Debugging</h2>
        <p>Errors and bugs are a fact of life in programming ― they will always be there. A ninja programmer will try to do 
            everything to minimize errors occurring, and find ways to identify and deal with them quickly.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">Errors, Exceptions, and Warnings</span></p>
        <p>Errors are caused when something goes wrong in a program. They are usually caused by one of the following:
            <ul>
                <li><span style="color: #fff;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #000;"> System error</span> ― there’s a 
                    problem with the system or external devices with which the program is interacting.</li>
                <li><span style="color: #fff;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #000;">Programmer error</span> ― the 
                    program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be as simple as a typo.</li>
                <li><span style="color: #fff;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #000;">User error</span> ― the user 
                    has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">Exceptions --></span> An exception is an
             error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">Stack Traces --></span>  is a sequence 
            of functions or method calls that lead to the point where the error occurred. It’s often not just a single function
             or method call that causes an error. A stack trace will work backwards from the point at which the error occurred 
             to identify the original function or method that started the sequence.           
        </p>
        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">Warnings --></span> A warning can occur 
            if there’s an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program to crash. This means the program will continue
             to run after a warning. <br>When a runtime error occurs in the browser, the HTML will still appear, but the JavaScript 
             code will stop working in the background, which isn’t always obvious at first. If a warning occurs, the JavaScript 
             will continue to run (although possibly incorrectly).</p>
        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">The Importance of Testing and Debugging --></span> 
            Instead of alerting a user to an error in a program, it just failed silently in the background, and this is sometimes 
            still the case. <br> Failing silently makes errors difficult to spot and longer to track down.
        </p>
        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">Strict Mode --></span> Writing code in strict 
            mode can also help improve its clarity and speed, since it follows conventions and will throw exceptions if any sloppy 
            code practices are used.
            <br> Strict mode encourages a better quality of JavaScript to be written that befits a ninja programmer, so its use is recommended.
            use 'strict'; -> If the engine does not support strict mode, this string will simply be ignored.
        </p>
        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">Linting Tools --></span> Linting tools can be used 
            to test the quality of JavaScript code, beyond simply using strict mode. They are designed to highlight any sloppy
             programming practices or syntax errors, and will complain if certain style conventions are not followed, such as how 
             code is indented. <br> Passing a lint test is no guarantee that your code is correct, but it will mean it will be more 
             consistent and less likely to have problems.</p>
     
        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">Feature Detection --></span> The recommended 
            way to determine browser support for a feature is to use feature detection. This is done using an if statement to
             check whether an object or method exists before trying to actually call the method.
        </p>
        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">Debugging in the Browser --></span> Debugging 
            is the process of finding out where bugs occur in the code and then dealing with them. In many cases, the point at which
             an error occurs is not always where it originated, so you’ll need to run through the program to see what’s happening at
              different stages of its execution.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span style="color: #fff;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #000;">The Trusty Alert >></span> use the alert() method
                to show a dialog at certain points in the code. Because alert() stops a program from running until OK is clicked, it
                 allows us to effectively put breakpoints in the code that let us check the value of variables at that point to see if
                  they’re what we expect them to be. <br>Using alerts for debugging was the only option in the past, but JavaScript 
                  development has progressed since then and their use is discouraged for debugging purposes today.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span style="color: #fff;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #000;">Using the Console >></span> Most modern JavaScript 
                environments have a console object that provides a number of methods for logging information and debugging. It's not 
                officially part of the ECMAScript specification, but is well supported in all the major browsers and Node.js.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span style="color: #fff;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #000;">Debugging Tools >></span> Most modern browsers also 
                have a debugging tool that allows you to set breakpoints in your code that will pause it at certain points. You can then 
                see the values of all the variables at those points and modify them. This can be very useful when trying to track down bugs. <br>
                One of the most useful commands is the debugger keyword. This will create a breakpoint in your code that will pause 
                the execution of the code and allow you to see where the program is currently up to.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">Error Objects --></span> An error object can be
             created by the host environment when an exception occurs, or it can be created in the code using a constructor function,
              like so: "const error = new Error();"<br>
              This constructor function takes a parameter that’s used as the error message:
              <ul>
                <li><span style="color: #fff;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #000;">EvalError</span> is not used in the current 
                    ECMAScript specification and only retained for backwards compatibility. It was used to identify errors when using
                     the global eval() function.
                    </li> 
                <li><span style="color: #fff;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #000;">RangeError</span>  is thrown when a number
                     is outside an allowable range of values.
                </li>
                <li><span style="color: #fff;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #000;">ReferenceError</span> is thrown when a reference is
                    made to an item that doesn’t exist. For example, calling a function that hasn't been defined.
                </li>
                <li><span style="color: #fff;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #000;">SyntaxError</span> is thrown when there’s an error in the code’s syntax.
                </li>
                <li><span style="color: #fff;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #000;">TypeError</span> is thrown when there’s
                     an error in the type of value used; for example, a string is used when a number is expected.
                </li>
                <li><span style="color: #fff;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #000;">URIError</span> is thrown when there’s a problem 
                    encoding or decoding the URI.
                </li>
                <li><span style="color: #fff;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #000;">InternalError</span> is a non-standard error that
                     is thrown when an error occurs in the JavaScript engine. A common cause of this too much recursion.
                </li>
              </ul>
        </p>

        <p>All error objects have a number of properties, but they’re often used inconsistently across browsers. The only properties that are generally safe to use are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The name property returns the name of the error constructor function used as a string, such as 'Error' or 'ReferenceError'.</li>
            <li>The message property returns a description of the error and should be provided as an argument to the Error constructor function.</li>
            <li>The stack property will return a stack trace for that error. This is a non-standard property and it’s recommended that it is not safe to use in production sites.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span style="color: #fff;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #000;">Throwing Exceptions >></span>  will allow for 
                    any problems in your code to be highlighted and dealt with, rather than lurk quietly in the background. <br> The 
                    throw statement can be applied to any JavaScript expression, causing the execution of the program to stop.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">Exception Handling --></span> It is possible 
            to handle exceptions gracefully by catching the error. Any errors can be hidden from users, but still identified. <br> If 
            we suspect a piece of code will result in an exception, we can wrap it in a try block. This will run the code inside the 
            block as normal, but if an exception occurs it will pass the error object that is thrown onto a catch block.
        </p>

        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">Tests --></span> Testing is an important part of 
            programming that can often be overlooked. Writing good tests means your code will be less brittle as it develops, and any 
            errors will be identified early on.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <span style="color: #fff;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #000;">Test-driven development (TDD) >></span>  
                is the process of writing tests before any actual code. <br> This is often referred to as the “red-green-refactor”
                 cycle of TDD, as failing tests usually show up as red, and tests that pass show as green.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span style="color: #fff;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #000;">Testing Frameworks >></span>  
                Testing frameworks provide a structure to write meaningful tests and then run them. There are a 
                large number of frameworks available for JavaScript.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span style="color: #fff;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #000;">Jest >></span>  
                Jest is a TDD framework, created by Facebook, that has gained a lot of popularity recently. It 
                makes it easy to create and run tests by providing helper methods for common test assertions.
