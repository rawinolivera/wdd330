        <h2>An Introduction to Functions, Execution Context and the Call Stack</h2>
        <p>This video explains how javascript works when it comes to process the code... <br>
            Javascript is sigle threaded and follow a synchronous execution parsing and executing line by line. <br><br>
            After the execution of every line, memory space is filling with data => Global Variable Environment! <br>
            Javascript follows the next actions: running / calling / invoking a function. <br>
            Call Stack helps keep tracking of the function being called.
        </p>

        <h2>Understand Callbacks & Higher Order Functions</h2>

        <p>Higher Order Functions takes Callbacks functions as a parameter or instructions. <br><br>
        Callback and Higher Order functions simplify our code and keep it DRY. <br>
        They do something even more powerful. They allow us to run asynchronous code.
        </p>
        <p>Function in Javascript = first class object: <br>
            1- Assigned to variables and properties of other object. <br>
            2- Passed as arguments into functions. <br>
            3- Return a value from functions.
