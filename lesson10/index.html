        <h2>An Introduction to Functions, Execution Context and the Call Stack</h2>
        <p>This video explains how javascript works when it comes to process the code... <br>
            Javascript is sigle threaded and follow a synchronous execution parsing and executing line by line. <br><br>
            After the execution of every line, memory space is filling with data => Global Variable Environment! <br>
            Javascript follows the next actions: running / calling / invoking a function. <br>
            Call Stack helps keep tracking of the function being called.
