        <h2>Javascript Novide to Ninja - Chapter 11: Further Function</h2>
        <p>Forms are a very common method of interacting with a web page. A form is the main component of Google’s home
            page, and most of us use forms every day to log in to our favorite sites.
        </p>
        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">Forms</span>
        </p>
        <p>Forms are made up of a < form> element that contains form controls such as input fields, select menus and
                buttons. These input fields
                can be populated with information that is processed once the form has been submitted.
        </p>

        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">A Searching Example</span>
        </p>
        <div style="text-align:center;"> <img src="../images/form-code.JPG" alt="Form html"> </div>
        <p>
            This form has a name attribute of search, and contains two controls: an input field where a user can enter a
            search phrase, and a button to submit the form. <br> The action attribute is the URL that the form will be
            submitted to so it can be processed on the server side. The input field also has a name attribute of
            searchInput that is used to access the information inside it.
        </p>

        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">Accessing Form Elements --></span> The
            legacy DOM had a useful property called document.forms that returns an HTML collection of all the forms
            in the document in the order they appear in the markup.</p>

        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">Form Properties and Methods --></span>
            Form objects have a number of useful properties and methods that can be used to interact with the form.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span style="color: #fff;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #000;">The form.submit() method</span> ― will
                submit the form automatically. Note that submitting a form using this method won’t trigger the form
                submit event.</li>
            <li><span style="color: #fff;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #000;">The form.reset() method</span> ― will
                reset all the form controls back to their initial values specified in the HTML.</li>
            <li><span style="color: #fff;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #000;">The form.action property</span> ― can be
                used to set the action attribute of a form, so it’s sent to a different URL to be processed on the
                server.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">Form Events --></span> Forms trigger a
            number of events. Some of these events are exclusive to forms. <br> The focus event occurs
            when an element is focused on. In the case of an < input> element, this is when the cursor is placed inside
                the element (either by clicking or tapping on it or navigating to it using the keyboard).
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span style="color: #fff;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #000;">The blur event</span> ― occurs when the
                user moves the focus away from the form element.</li>
            <li><span style="color: #fff;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #000;">The change event</span> ― occurs when the
                user moves the focus away from the form element after changing it. So if a user clicks in an input field
                and makes no changes, and then clicks elsewhere, the change event won’t fire, but the blur event will.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">Retrieving and Changing Values From a
                Form --></span> Text input element objects have a value property that can be used to retrieve the text
            inside the field. <br> We can use this to report back what the user has searched for.</p>

        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">Form Controls --></span>
            Some common types of form control are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span style="color: #fff;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #000;">
                    < input>
                </span> fields, including text, passwords, check boxes, radio buttons, and file uploads</li>
            <li><span style="color: #fff;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #000;">
                    < select>
                </span> menus for drop-down lists of options.</li>
            <li><span style="color: #fff;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #000;">
                    < textarea>
                </span> elements for longer text entry.</li>
            <li><span style="color: #fff;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #000;">
                    < button>
                </span> elements for submitting and resetting forms.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">Input Fields</span>
        </p>

        <p>
            Input fields are the most common types of form control, but there are several categories of input field as
            you’ll soon see:
        </p>

        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">Text Input Fields --></span> The default
            type of input field is text, which is used for entering a short piece of text, such as a username. The
            type='text' attribute is advisable to use it as it makes the intended purpose of the field explicit, helping
            with maintenance, readability and future-proofing.
        </p>
        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">Password Input Fields --></span> input
            type='password' is used to enter passwords or secret information. This works in the same way as an input
            field with type='text', except the characters are concealed as they are entered so they’re unable to be read
            on the screen.
        </p>

        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">Checkbox Input Fields --></span> Check
            boxes are created using input fields with type='checkbox'. They are used to select different options that
            can be checked (true) or left unchecked (false). The user can select more than one checkbox from a list.
        </p>
        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">Radio Button Input Fields --></span>
            Radio buttons are created using input fields with type='radio'. Like checkboxes they allow users to check an
            option as true, but they provide an exclusive choice of options, so only one option can be selected.
        </p>

        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">Hidden Input Fields --></span> Hidden
            fields can be created using input fields with type='hidden'. These are not displayed by the browser, but
            have a 'value' attribute that can contain information that is submitted with the form. They are often used
            to send information such as settings or information that the user has already provided. <br>Note that the
            information in these fields is in no way secret, as it’s visible in the HTML, so shouldn’t be used for
            sensitive data.
        </p>
        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">File Input Fields --></span>
            A file input field can be created using input fields with type='file'. These are used to upload files, and
            most browsers will provide a browse button or similar that lets users select a file from their file system.
        </p>
        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">Other Input Types --></span>
            There are lots of new input types included in HTML5, such as number, tel and color. As browsers start to
            support these, they will implement different user-interface elements depending on the input type.

        <div style="text-align:center;"> <img src="../images/inputs.JPG" alt="Inputs"> </div>

        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">Select Drop-Down List --></span> Select
            drop-down lists can be used to select one or more options from a list of values. The 'multiple' attribute is
            required if more than one option is to be selected.
        </p>
        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">Text Areas --></span>
            A < textarea> element is used to enter long pieces of text over multiple lines such as a comment or blog
                post. They work in much the same way as input fields. We access them using the 'name' attribute, and use
                the value property to see what text was entered.
        </p>

        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">Buttons --></span> There are different
            types of buttons. The default type is 'submit', Another type we’ve already seen is 'reset', which will reset
            all the form fields to their initial settings.
        </p>

        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">Form Validation</span>
        </p>
        <p>s the process of checking whether a user has entered the information into a form correctly. Examples of the
            types of validation that occur include ensuring that:
        </p>

        <ul>    
            <li>
                <span style="color: #fff;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #000;">A required field is completed.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span style="color: #fff;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #000;">An email address is valid.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span style="color: #fff;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #000;">A number is entered when numerical data
                    is required.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span style="color: #fff;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #000;">A password is at least a minimum number
                    of characters.</span>
            </li>

        </ul>
        <p>
            Validation can occur on the client side using JavaScript, and on the server side. It is advisable to use
            both client-side and server-side validation. JavaScript should not be relied upon to validate any data
            before it’s saved to a database. This is because it’s possible for a user to modify the JavaScript code and
            bypass the validation rules. It's also very easy to bypass the front-end completely and send arbitrary data
            to the application's backend. For these reasons, JavaScript validation should be used to enhance the user
            experience when filling in a form by giving feedback about any errors before it’s submitted. This should
            then be backed up with more validation performed on the server before the data is eventually saved to a
            database. Having said that, it’s still useful to validate on the client side even if the data will be
            validated again on the server side. This is because it will ensure that more valid data is sent to the
            server, which helps to cut down the number of HTTP requests required to send the form back and forward from
            the server to be corrected.
        </p>

        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">Disabling the Submit Button --></span>
            Another useful technique that can aid usability is to disable the submit button if there are errors on the
            form. If the submit button is disabled then no action is taken when it’s clicked. Most browsers will also
            display it in a lighter color to indicate that it cannot be clicked on. This prevents users from submitting
            a form containing any errors.
        </p>

        <p><span style="color: #000051;text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .3rem #33a3ff;">Using FormData Objects
            Effectively (13min)</span>
            This was repeat several times in the video: to work inside the FormData Object, you have to have the name
            attribute inside of your input element!</p>
